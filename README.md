# Python Escape the Room Project

Repository for the first Data Analytics Project - Python

This project consisted in creating a 'Escape-the-room' minigame.

### Brief Wiki Description:

An escape room, also known as an escape game, puzzle room or exit game, is a game in which a team of players discover clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks in one or more rooms in order to accomplish a specific goal in a limited amount of time. The goal is often to escape from the site of the game. Most escape games are cooperative but competitive variants exist. Escape rooms became popular in North America, Europe and East Asia in the 2010s. Permanent escape rooms in fixed locations were first opened in Asia and followed later in Hungary, Serbia, Australia, New Zealand, Russia and South America.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to apply the Python programming skills in solving a real problem.

## How to run the game

1. Either fork or download the repository into your computer.
2. Install all the requirements (none - for this project we used pure python or native libraries).
3. Open " Python-Escape-the-room-Project/your-code/final-version/ironhack-game.py " in a console.

## How to play the game

1. Run the " ironhack-game.py " in a console.
2. Insert your name and gender in the command line.
3. In each room you have two options: "explore" or "examine"
3.1. Explore: When you select explore you see all the object in the room
3.2. Examine: When you select examine you can interact with the objects
4. When you examine a character that has a key you can advance to the next room via a door.
5. The goal is to escape all rooms!
